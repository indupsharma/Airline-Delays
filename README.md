# Airline-Delays

Abstract
There are thousands of individuals who face inconvenience and maybe even skipping on events such as weddings, funerals, sporting or maybe even vacations due to the flights getting delayed.
A flight is deemed to be delayed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) when it departs 15 mins after scheduled time. The idea for this topic as my final presentation occurred to me when I was traveling to Florida for a conference and the airlines which I booked got delayed by 1 hour 30 mins. Which was the case with other fellow mates who had come from California and Seattle.
The initial idea was to find out the airline who had enormous flight delays from 2009 to 2018. As per the feedback received, the dataset was changed to flight delays in the US from January 2022 to August 2022. This study demonstrates the possible reasons for flights getting delayed by channelizing it using Azure VM, Spark technologies, Jupyter notebook. Exploratory data analysis was conducted in pyspark, python and sql following that the machine learning was conducted in pyspark.
